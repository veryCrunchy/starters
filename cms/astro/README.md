# Astro Simple CMS Template with Directus Integration

This is an **Astro-based Simple CMS Template** that is fully integrated with [Directus](https://directus.io/), offering
a CMS solution for managing and delivering content seamlessly. The template leverages modern technologies like **Astro’s
File-based Routing**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shadcn components**, providing a complete and scalable starting point for
building CMS-powered web applications.

## **Features**

- **Astro File-based Routing**: Uses Astro's file-based routing for layouts and dynamic routes.
- **Full Directus Integration**: Directus API integration for fetching and managing relational data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Fully integrated for rapid UI styling.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and reliable code quality.
- **Shadcn Components**: Pre-built, customizable UI components for modern design systems.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Enforces consistent code quality and formatting.
- **Dynamic Page Builder**: A page builder interface for creating and customizing CMS-driven pages.
- **Preview Mode**: Built-in draft/live preview for editing unpublished content.
- **Optimized Dependency Management**: Project is set up with **pnpm** for faster and more efficient package management.

## **Why pnpm?**

This project uses `pnpm` for managing dependencies due to its speed and efficiency. If you’re familiar with `npm`,
you’ll find `pnpm` very similar in usage. You can still use `npm` if you prefer by replacing `pnpm` commands with their
`npm` equivalents.

## **Draft Mode in Directus and Live Preview**

### **Draft Mode Overview**

Directus allows you to work on unpublished content using **Draft Mode**. This Astro template is configured to support
Directus Draft Mode out of the box, enabling live previews of unpublished or draft content as you make changes.

### **Live Preview Setup**

[Directus Live Preview](https://docs.directus.io/guides/headless-cms/live-preview/nextjs.html)

- The live preview feature works seamlessly on deployed environments.
- To preview content on **localhost**, use your browser's preview mode or deploy your application to a staging
  environment.
- **Important Note**: Directus employs Content Security Policies (CSPs) that block live previews on `localhost` for
  security reasons. For a smooth preview experience, deploy the application to a cloud environment and use the
  deployment URL for Directus previews.

---

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

To set up this template, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** (16.x or newer)
- **npm** or **pnpm**
- Access to a **Directus** instance ([cloud or self-hosted](../../README.md))

## ⚠️ Directus Setup Instructions

For instructions on setting up Directus, choose one of the following:

- [Setting up Directus Cloud](https://github.com/directus-labs/starters?tab=readme-ov-file#using-directus-with-a-cloud-instance-recommended)
- [Setting up Directus Self-Hosted](https://github.com/directus-labs/starters?tab=readme-ov-file#using-directus-locally)

### **Environment Variables**

To get started, you need to configure environment variables. Follow these steps:

1. **Copy the example environment file:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Update the following variables in your `.env` file:**

   - **`PUBLIC_DIRECTUS_URL`**: URL of your Directus instance.
   - **`DIRECTUS_PUBLIC_TOKEN`**: Public token for accessing public resources in Directus. Use the token from the
     **Webmaster** account.
   - **`DIRECTUS_FORM_TOKEN`**: Token from the **Frontend Bot User** account in Directus for handling form submissions.
   - **`PUBLIC_SITE_URL`**: The public URL of your site. This is used for SEO metadata and blog post routing.
   - **`DRAFT_MODE_SECRET`**: The secret you generate for live preview. This is used to view draft posts in Directus and
     live edits.
   - **`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_VISUAL_EDITING`**: Enable or disable visual editing in Directus

---

## **Running the Application**

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   _(You can also use `npm install` if you prefer.)_

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

3. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## **Generate Directus Types**

This repository includes a [utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/directus-sdk-typegen) to generate TypeScript types
for your Directus schema.

#### Usage

1. Ensure your `.env` file is configured as described above.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   pnpm run generate:types
   ```

## 📖 Component Structure in Astro & React

Our project is built with **Astro** for performance and **React** for interactivity. To optimize **server-side rendering
(SSR)** while keeping **interactive components responsive**, we use **both Astro (`.astro`) and React (`.tsx`)
components**, depending on their needs.

---

## 🛠️ Why Do We Have Two Versions of Some Components?

Some components exist in **both `.astro` and `.tsx` versions** to ensure they are used in the most efficient way:

- **Astro Components (`.astro`)** are used whenever a component is **static** and **doesn't need Directus visual
  editing** (e.g., `Footer.astro`).
- **React Components (`.tsx`)** are used when interactivity is needed or when the component needs to support Directus
  visual editing (e.g., `Gallery.tsx`, `Form.tsx`, `ThemeToggle.tsx`, `Pricing.tsx`).
- **If a component might be used inside both Astro and React**, we provide **both versions** (e.g., `Headline.astro` and
  `Headline.tsx`).

---

## 📌 Adding or Modifying Components

### ✅ Use Astro (`.astro`) when:

✔ The component is **purely static** (text, images, basic layouts).  
✔ It does **not require interactivity or client-side state**.  
✔ It is used inside other Astro components.  
✔ It **doesn't need Directus visual editing support**.

### ✅ Use React (`.tsx`) when:

✔ The component **requires client-side state, interactivity, or event listeners** (e.g., toggles, modals, forms).  
✔ It **depends on a React-based UI library** (e.g., `ShadCN`, `Lucide Icons`).  
✔ It needs to be **used inside a React component** (Astro cannot directly import React logic).  
✔ It **needs to support Directus visual editing**.

### ✅ Provide Both Astro & React Versions when:

✔ The component is mostly static **but might be used inside both Astro and React** (e.g., `Headline`, `Tagline`,
`Text`).  
✔ The component needs different rendering strategies depending on context.

## ✨ Key Takeaways

🔹 **Astro for non-visual editing components** → We use Astro when visual editing is not needed.  
🔹 **React for visual editing and interactivity** → Components that need Directus visual editing or client-side
interactivity.  
🔹 **Follow the structure** → If modifying or adding components:

- **Use Astro for static components that don't need visual editing.**
- **Use React for components that need visual editing or interactivity.**
- **If a component needs to be used in both contexts, create both versions.**

🚀 **This setup ensures compatibility with Directus visual editing while maintaining Astro's performance benefits where
possible!**

---

## 📌 When Adding a New Component:

- **Is it static and doesn't need visual editing?** → **Use `.astro`.**
- **Does it need interactivity or visual editing?** → **Use `.tsx`.**
- **Will it be used inside both React & Astro?** → **Create both versions.**
